    <h2>Markup 1</h2>
    <p>
        According to <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Wikipedia</a></cite>, there was
        <em><mark>never</mark></em> a version 1.4 of HTML.
        <!-- <dl><dt><dd> is not allowed in a paragraph and <section> is not allowed and <p> is not allowed
        but "The <p> element, the <dt>/<dd> pairing, or the <section> element which is the nearest ancestor of
        the <dfn> is considered to be the definition of the term." according to W3C. So in this case, the whole paragraph
        would be considered the definition of the term W3C, which is wrong, but there is nothing I can do about it except for
        creating two paragraphs instead of 1, but the assignment asks for this passage to be inside one paragraph. -->
        <dfn>The W3C</dfn> is the World Wide Web Consortium, and it defines HTML.
